##Overview
Have a metasploit installation from the binary package? (Hint: unless you cloned `metasploit-framework` from source, then the answer is yes.)

Simply:

```
# curl alexlevinson.com/msfp | bash
```
Then you have the commands:

 * `power_shell`
 * `power_view`
 * `power_up`
 
From within Meterpreter.

Enjoy.
